**Keep your documentation as fresh as your code!**

FreshDocs is an app that helps developers and users maintain a real, actionable connection between documentation and source code. 
By embedding hidden comment annotations in doc files, you can link docs to specific code files or folders. 
Whenever the code changes, FreshDocs detects which documentation is now stale ‚Äî so your docs never fall behind.

FreshDocs can also be used by developers to quickly find what documentation will need to be updated for the changes they are making!

## üöÄ Features

- **Code-to-Doc Linkage:** Use simple annotations to connect markdown files to code.

## üõ†Ô∏è Installation

```

## üìñ How It Works

1. **Initialise freshdocs**  
   Navigate to where you want to store the fresh config and run
   ```bash
   fresh init
   ```
2. **Update the configuration**  
   The app will provide placeholder values that you can modify
   
   More than one target repository can be specified, and more than one
   document folder can be configured too.

   ```yaml
   version: 1
   repositories:
      core:
        path: ../my-service
      utils:
        path: ../shared-utils
   documentGroups:
   - path: ./docs/folder
     ext: .md

   ```
3. **Add annotations to your documents**  
   
   ```md
   # the following is an annotation
   
   <!--- fresh:file core:folder/to/file.go -->
   ```
   
   For a full list of supported annotations, see here

some/docs/path.md
another/docs/path.md
```
